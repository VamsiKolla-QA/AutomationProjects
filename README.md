AutomationProjects
Overview
This repository is a collection of various automation and Quality Assurance (QA) projects created to showcase my skills in automating tasks and performing robust testing in different domains. The projects here demonstrate the implementation of different automation techniques using industry-standard tools and technologies.

As a part of my journey to becoming a skilled QA professional, I aim to create real-world, testable examples of my work that will demonstrate my expertise in automating testing processes, improving software quality, and ensuring smooth delivery pipelines.

Goals
The primary goal of this repository is to:

Showcase practical automation and testing skills through various projects.
Provide clear, maintainable, and reusable code for automating test cases.
Demonstrate best practices for testing APIs, UI applications, and performance.
Explore different aspects of the QA lifecycle, such as test planning, execution, reporting, and integration.
The projects you’ll find here are intended to highlight the following:

Test Automation Frameworks: Design and implement test automation frameworks (e.g., for REST APIs, Web Applications, etc.).
API Testing: Automate tests for RESTful APIs, validating endpoints, request/response data, status codes, and error handling.
Performance Testing: Automating performance tests and using tools like JMeter or custom solutions.
CI/CD Integration: Integrating automated tests into a continuous integration pipeline (e.g., using Jenkins, GitHub Actions).
Test Reporting: Automatically generating clear test execution reports and logs for easy debugging and progress tracking.
Technologies Used
This repository includes projects developed using the following tools and technologies:

Languages: Python
Libraries/Tools:
pytest, unittest, requests, allure
Postman for exploratory API testing
GitHub Actions for CI/CD
Other Tools: GitHub, PyCharm, Jenkins, JIRA, TestRail (if applicable)
How to Contribute
If you’d like to contribute to any of the projects, feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Your contributions are welcome!

Future Plans
Extend the existing test cases to cover more scenarios.
Add additional projects related to UI Automation (Selenium/WebDriver).
Implement performance/load testing solutions.
Expand documentation for each project, including installation and usage instructions.
Feel free to modify the contents based on your actual skills and the tools you’ve used in your projects! This README will give visitors a clear understanding of the purpose of the repository and its goals.
